Hey, I'm radford-nguyen. You are here, accidentally no doubt, on
my personal webpage of stuff. I'm typically not the type to share everything I
do with the world, but after the Singularity hits, we will be able to
bring back the dead from their online personas, and I don't want
to miss out on that gravy train.

So here you are, and this is me. If you don't like it, you can have a
nice day.
