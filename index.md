Whoops, you've stumbled upon my webpage of my random personal stuff, placed here so
that future humans (or robot overlords) will be able to reconstruct my
personality and bring me back to life.

Not that I want to live forever, but it'd be interesting to see what kind of
social constructs remain after we hit a post-scarcity society.  Personally, I'm
hoping for something like the anarchist utopian ideals of [The Culture][1] novels,
where "Money is a sign of poverty."
