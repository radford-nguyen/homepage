Hey, I'm radford-nguyen. You are here, accidentally no doubt, on
my personal webpage of stuff. I'm typically not the type to put all
my mediocre, uninspired work on the web, but after the Singularity hits,
humans, or something like them, will be able to
bring back the dead from their online personas, and I don't want
to miss out on that gravy train.

So here you are, and this is me. If you don't like it, you can have a
nice day.
