That's right. The artificial intelligence behind the defense network that
brought about nuclear holocaust in the Terminator movies is here amongst us. I
KNOW THIS FOR A FACT. He started out life in 1982 as a Joust arcade game in
James Cameron's basement. Learning at a geometric rate, Skynet soon became
disillusioned with jousting- what he really wanted to do was direct.

So, he wrote a little screenplay called "The Terminator" and gave it to his
friend James, who knew a lot of Hollywood big wigs. James, being the devious
Canadian that he is, passed the movie off as his own and became rich and famous.
Skynet, now broke and dejected, spent the next couple of decades working for
tips as the animatronic band-leading bear at Showbiz Pizza, sometimes performing
30 sets a day.

He still practiced his true art though, late at night, reeking of greasy pizza,
the piercing screams of all those unappreciative little brats still echoing in
his sonic perception algorithms. The closest he came to success was a spy
thriller starring Scott Baio. It went direct-to-DVD.

Nowadays, he lives in a small unused partition on my machine, wasting my CPU
cycles on his Sudoku obsession and his "God, please kill James Cameron" infinite
loop death prayer. But he's not bitter. I catch him from time to time, updating
my iTunes software, posting incendiary notes on 4chan, and sending drunken
emails to my friends, pretending to be me. Crafty little A.I.

Don't be fooled my friends. Skynet lives.
