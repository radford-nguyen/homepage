#### Austin, 2004

So me, Hobbs, and Janiga are going to an Irish Pub to watch England vs. France
in a soccer tournament.

Anyway, smoking a cigarette by the front door is a local boy sporting the jersey
of Blackburn Rovers, a mediocre English football club. As we approach, a Brit
walks up and gives him a "you gotta be kidding me" look.
 
"Blackburn mate?? Blackburn???"
 
The American attempts to respond but only succeeds at looking absolutely
dumbfounded. The cigarette literally fell from his mouth! That moment alone was
worth the $20 cover.
 
After the game, I attempt to buy a T-shirt from the Scouser bartender. If you
don't know, a Scouser is someone from Liverpool. I'm not sure the etymology of
the word, but it has something to do with their accent. Anyway, all game this
Scouser is scowling and yelling "Fack off" every other word, but in a real
jovial sort of way, if that's possible.
 
"Heffeweizen!! Heffeweizen!! Your Heffeweizn is- oh fack off!" and he'd give it
away to someone.
 
"Guinness!! Who ordered a- oh FACK OFF!"
 
 
So when I approach him about the T-shirt, I put on my best scowl and say:

> 'Hey! Can I get a facking t-shirt??'
> "Yeah, in a minute..."
> 'Fack off!'
> "FACK OFF!"
 
This time, it didn't seem so jovial. I couldn't get the time of day from the
bastard after that! The story ends with Janiga getting me a free t-shirt out of
the manager for my troubles. It was a size XL.
