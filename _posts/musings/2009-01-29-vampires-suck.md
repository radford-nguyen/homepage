And ceiling fans blow. ::rimshot::

No seriously, vampires do suck. And not
because they slowly drain the life and emotion out of you, leaving behind a
shriveled husk of a human being filled only with the crusty artifacts of despair
and an intense disdain for all things good. No, it's because THEY DON'T SHOWER,
PEOPLE.

That's right- vampires do NOT take personal hygiene very seriously. They're
fucking undead! Don't get me wrong, everyone secretly (or openly, if you're a
perv) wants to smell everyone else. But make me work for it. Give me the choice
of not having your blood-sucking B.O. particles all up in my face. Yes, I know
you can't die. But have some effing pride man- you're descended from nobility.
