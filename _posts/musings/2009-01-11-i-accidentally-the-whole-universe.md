I went to sleep last night for the first time in 51 hours or so. The previous 2
days were spent in a frenzy of extremely productive work, punctuated by the
occasional "waking nap"... (that moment when you're driving down the highway,
and you realize that you have been dreaming for the last 15 seconds)

During my sleepy-time proper, I had some wild dreams complete with soundtrack
and in some cases, narration. Good times. After I woke up and took a shower, I
walked into the bedroom to discover a beat-up old package by my door. The return
address simply read "Not here" and the box was post-marked with giant stamps
that looked like they last saw the light of day in 1922. I clumsily ripped it
open to find a weathered leather journal inside. The pages were stained and
yellow with age and covered in densely-packed mathematical symbols and
half-legible scribblings. Like an impetuous child of the ADHD Age, I
impatiently flipped to the last entry. It was dated... today... 5 minutes from
now. "Whatever," I shrugged and began reading.

"OOF," I seemed to say as I stubbed my toe on the corner of the bed,
"sonofabitchialwaysdothat!" I tossed the journal aside and moved around the room
in slow motion in a futile attempt to ease the pain. Futile attempt to ease the
pain? My thoughts immediately turned to my former love interest... "fuck off" lol.
Then, in that brief moment of levity and for no reason
at all, I thought of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. "Oh fuc...."

Darkness. Silence. Nothingness. Way to unmake all of existence, dumbass. Wait a
minute. Why can I still hear myself thinking? I opened my eyes to find myself
lying comically askew in my bed, still wearing my clothes from the day before
and _definitely_ not freshly showered. My toe even hurt a little bit. Holy fuck
shit that was a good dream.
