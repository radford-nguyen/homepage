Yeah. Not like water-boarding or anything. Much more serious stuff.

It all began as I was driving back to Austin in the wee hours of the morning.
Somewhere near the intersection of Hwy 71 and I-10, I realized that all my tunes
were sandwiched between the passenger door and the 10 lbs cooler of turkey
riding shotgun. _No problem. I'll just turn on the radio_.

The local jazz station was playing some Earl Hines. _Awwww yeah, I can get used
to this!_

I drive out of range within 30 seconds. _Fuck._

_What else is on? Country.
No. Country. No. Classic Rock. No, I'm not that tired yet. What the? Can it be??
Holy shit it can- it's THE MONKEES._

I TURN UP THE VOLUME. Elgin's own KKLB 92.5FM is playing "Pleasant Valley
Sunday" by The Monkees. _Ahahaha this was the first cassette tape I ever owned!_

> I used to watch The Monkees' show every afternoon after school. When it wasn't
> on, I would act out my own Monkees shows- "aping" them, as it were. *pun groan*
> 
> My parents made me the happiest little Radford when they bought me The Monkees'

> little red Fisher-Price tape player. They never bought me music again.

Ok, ok, get to the torture, you say. So I'm fucking JAMMING OUT to the song, and
it's fucking GREAT. As the last refrain fades away, I quietly wish that I could
hear it again. _Oh weird, this next song starts out the exact same way. Hey! It
IS the same song! This DJ and I are on the same page- yusssssss!_ So I get to
hear my song twice in a row. My night is made!

Then I get to hear it 3 times in a row. Then 4. _Haha, the DJ accidentally left
it on repeat when he went to the bathroom or something. I'm gonna keep it on
this station until he realizes his mistake. This is gonna be fun!_ Well, the DJ
never came back. I'm not even sure he was ever really there! But at least I got
to hear Pleasant Valley Sunday about A FUCK MILLION TIMES. Let me take you
through my progression:

#### Iterations 1-10
> I am in a euphoric state of nostalgia, able to sense the smells and sounds of my
> childhood. Life cannot get any better.
> 
#### Iterations 25-50
> The funny way Mikey pronounces "charcoal" is starting to get on my nerves, but I
> resolve not to break my vow. My mind wanders and replays the entire Simpsons
> episode where Marge has flashbacks about a Monkees lunchbox.
> 
#### Iterations 100-200
> I have committed every single individual track in the song to memory- I SHIT YOU
> NOT. Drums, bass, lead and rhythm guitar, bongos, tambourine, melody, harmonies-
> I can play and sing them all.
> 
#### Iterations 500-1000
> I freak out when Davy Jones's face appears in my rearview mirror and nearly
> drive into the Colorado River.
> 
#### Iterations 5000-10000
> I start to have flashbacks about a Monkees lunchbox.
> 
#### Iterations 1000000-666666666666666666
> I have forgotten every single track in the song, but it doesn't matter because I
> have seen the face of God. I have seen Him and HE'S TERRIFYING.

By the time I pull into my garage, tears are streaming down my face, I am
shivering uncontrollably, and I can no longer distinguish between Right and
Wrong. I am officially broken, CIA style. Hundreds of miles away, my parents are
snickering to themselves in their sleep. Just another pleasant valley
sunday.
