So I've been butchering this penguin joke for a couple of years. Never told the
exact same way twice (like a beautiful fucking snowflake), it's this
meandering story about a workaholic penguin with some serious psychological
issues. Well... besides being a workaholic. It turns out that our poor little
penguin has a real fucking aversion to heat- hot weather gives him incredible
_ANXIETY_... but he's a _workaholic_, so he can't say no when his boss asks him
to drive to Vegas in a car with no A/C! Poor little guy is torn. You know, you gotta
get your audience emotionally involved- caring about what happens to the
penguin.

Anyway, the other day I was giving a particularly moving rendition
of the joke. There wasn't a dry eye in the room.  Suddenly, "Oh, I know this
one..."

> A penguin is eating icecream when he goes to pick up his car.
>
> "Looks like you blew a seal," says the mechanic.
>
> "Nah, it's just ice cream," says the penguin.

Brought the motherfucking house down.
