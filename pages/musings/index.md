Usually, I stay sane by [playing soccer][1]. When the game is played at a
sufficiently tactical level, it is just as much about speed-of-thought
as it is about physical strength and endurance. It's a fucking shot of life.

But sometimes the weather is shit for weeks at a time...

> You ask me how I became a madman. It happened thus:
>
> One day, long before many gods

> masks I have fashioned and worn in seven lives -- I ran maskless through the crowded
> streets shouting, "Thieves, thieves, the cursed thieves." 
>
> Men and women laughed at me and some ran to their houses in fear of me. 
>
> And when I reached the market place, a youth standing on a house-top cried, "He is a
> madman." I looked up to behold him; the sun kissed my own naked face for the first
> time. For the first time the sun kissed my own naked face and my soul was inflamed
> with love for the sun, and I wanted my masks no more. And as if in a trance I cried,
> "Blessed, blessed are the thieves who stole my masks." 
>
> Thus I became a madman. 
>
> And I have found both freedom and safety in my madness; the freedom of loneliness
> and the safety from being understood, for those who understand us enslave something
> in us. 
>
> But let me not be too proud of my safety. Even a Thief in a jail is safe from another thief.
