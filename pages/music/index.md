---------------------------------------

A while back, I acquired a copy of [Reason 4.0][1], a badass digital audio workstation
for creating music. With my background in piano etc..., I still
prefer making music in real-time without a computer, but Reason has taught me a shit-ton about the
composition, arranging, and production side of things (namely, that I suck at it.)

This is my collection of random scratch work created with Reason alone.
